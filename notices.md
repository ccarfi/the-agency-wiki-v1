## Legal Disclaimer

Duda is not a law firm. As such, Duda does not provide legal advice. The material in this guide does not constitute legal advice nor does contributing to the guide or communicating with Duda or other contributors about the guide create an attorney-client relationship.

Open source projects are made available and contributed to under licenses that include terms that, for the protection of contributors, make clear that the projects are offered "as-is", without warranty, and disclaiming liability for damages resulting from using the projects. This guide is no different. The open content license it is offered under [includes such terms](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s5).

Running an open source project, like any human endeavor, involves uncertainty and trade-offs. We hope this guide helps, but it may include mistakes, and can't address every situation. If you have any questions about your project, we encourage you to do your own research, seek out experts, and discuss with your community. If you have any legal questions, you should consult with your own legal counsel before moving forward. If you're at a company, [talk to its legal team](../legal/#what-does-my-companys-legal-team-need-to-know).
