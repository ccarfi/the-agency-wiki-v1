# How to Grow a Medium Agency into a Large One

Once you've been in business for a while, you may hit a growth plateau. To learn how to move beyond that point, we sat down with [Erin Lizzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinlizzo/), a Strategic Account Manager at Duda who has spent the past two years working with dozens of partners to expand their customer bases, increase their bottom lines and get their organizations to the next level. Here is what Erin had to say about scaling up a digital agency or SaaS company with 150 websites under management and how they can move beyond that plateau.


### TAW: Let's say you're a SaaS company or digital agency with 150 websites under management and want to make a concentrated effort to take your business to the next level and expand your customer base. What are the first things you need to do? What does the agenda look like?

EL: So, the first thing you want to do is evaluate your current process and really think about what has worked to get you to where you currently are. Have you had success with specific verticals? Do customers respond well to certain payment plans and pricing models? How have you optimized your own workflows to streamline your site building process? There are usually clues in your business history that can help you figure out how to make successful moves.

After you feel like you have a firm idea of what your current strengths and weaknesses are, you're ready to start thinking about what growth will look like.

This often involves introducing a new business model or way of selling websites. For example, if you've been building sites for your clients in a do-it-for-me model, now is the time to lean on those tools in Duda that help you automate more of your process and create more of a do-it-with-me flow.

### TAW: What does a do-it-with-me workflow look like?

EL: A DIWM workflow involves the customer filling out a content collection form in some way, either via email or during the actual sign up flow, that will pre-load a lot of their important business information into a website. This cuts down on a lot of the back and forth with customers and can really help streamline your process. Site Comments is also a great tool inside the Duda platform that allows you to share feedback with customers and teammates directly on a website as it's being built for prompt and clear communication between all stakeholders.  

### TAW: Would you want to scrap the DIFM model in favor of a DIWM model?

EL: No, not at all. If you can offer both that's great. However, you may want to think about introducing tiered plans that include a basic DIWM flow at the low end, and a full DIFM white-glove experience at the top. This way you can bring on more customers at scale and still keep a reserve of clients that pay a premium for you to work closely with them in a more traditional sense. 

### TAW: In addition to introducing new workflows, would you recommend diversifying the products you offer?

EL: It's certainly time to start thinking about it. If someone has hit the 150 website mark, what that tells me is they've probably got their web design game dialed in pretty well and it's time to consider adding other services like email marketing or display advertising. The key is to focus on services you think you can easily tie back to the website so your offer is seen as a complete package of everything your customer needs to effectively manage their digital presence.

### TAW: In our interview about growing your business with 50 websites under management, your teammate Erik Kosnar made the point that you may want to consider focusing on building sites for a few key verticals and expand your customer base that way. Is that something you would recommend doing at this stage?

EL: Focusing on specific verticals can make a lot of sense if you're in the early stages of growing your business. At 150 websites, it sort of depends. If you've already had success in a verticalized approach, it probably wouldn't hurt to add a few more. So if you've had success with lawyers and electricians, it might make sense to add doctors and plumbers. However, I'd say that once you have 150 websites, you might want to consider a more product-centric play.

For example, I have one very successful Duda partner who offers software for creating logos. Once a customer's logo is created, it's automatically applied to a brand new Duda website and served up as a package deal. Marketing the general benefits of this solution, as opposed to marketing to specific verticals, is where the our partner has spent most of their energy and it's paid off really well.

### TAW: Earlier in our conversation, we talked about how you can improve your workflow. But is that enough? Do you need to start thinking about adding staff at this point?

EL: It's really critical to make sure you're leveraging the full power of your toolset when you enter a growth phase, but yes, at a certain point you're simply going to need more people power. Particularly you're going to want to hire more sales people, and maybe a support agent or two. This is assuming you already have a couple of designers and developers on staff, of course. ﻿

### TAW: Why do you need to hire more sales people in particular?

﻿EL: If you've taken advantage of a DIWM workflow, sales people can sort of serve two roles. They act as the frontline representative for your company and are responsible for closing deals, but they're also what you could call associate designers.

Generally speaking, our customers who organize their business in this way have a few designers that spend most of their time working on templates and custom designs for high-value clients. The templates are then presented to potential customers by your sales team, enabling them to get an idea of what their site could look like.  Once they've chosen a template, your sales person simply needs to enter some of their information into Duda's Content Library and  can spin up a full website with everything a small business needs in just a few minutes. It's a very efficient way to offer websites to clients and close deals quickly.

### TAW: As far as marketing your business and getting in front of customers, I suppose the sales people aren't exactly pounding the pavement and knocking doors in your hometown anymore...

EL: Correct. If you already have 150 websites under management, you're almost assuredly doing your own digital marketing to bring in leads. Maybe you have some sales people workin on outbound. But at this point, you really want to focus on building up your inbound strategy and looking for co-marketing opportunities with other organizations. Education and content marketing are also areas to look at. 

### TAW: What's a common misstep that people should actively try to avoid when entering a growth phase like this?

Don't jump the gun. I've seen a few people start to market their product and packages before they're ready for rollout and it's caused some issues. Just be sure you have your launch plan thoroughly baked out and adhere to a schedule when it comes to client communications.
