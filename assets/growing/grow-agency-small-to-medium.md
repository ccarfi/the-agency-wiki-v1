# How to Grow a Small Agency

One of the most common questions we've heard from agency owners is "How do I grow my digital agency?" Here is an interview with [Erik Kosnar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikkosnar/), a long-time agency, community-building, and web development leader, who shares some of his advice. 


### When a digital agency with around 50 websites decides it wants to strategically enter a growth phase and ramp up their customer acquisition, what’s the first step they should take?

In my experience, what worked to get you to 50 websites isn’t the same as what will work to get you to 150. A lot of companies at this size built their businesses by creating bespoke websites for customers across different verticals in a specific geographic area. This formula can work in the early days, but at around 50 websites, site management and churn become constant issues unless you change the paradigm. Building and supporting highly custom websites for individual customers just isn’t scalable at that size unless you hire more staff, and that would bring down profit margins. 

So the first thing you need to do is optimize your site building flows. Start thinking about how you can create beautiful designs quickly and what commonalities there are among your customers’ sites. There are a lot of tools and features with tools like Duda that will help you with this like custom site sections and the ability to create your own templates. You can also create entirely new custom widgets inside your platform for easy integrations with solutions that are common to your customers. For example, if you have a bunch of customers using HubSpot as a CRM, you can use the widget builder to create an integration that can simply be dragged and dropped onto new customers’ websites.

Creating these assets beforehand and working them into your design process saves hours of time. If you want to make it from 50 websites to 150, you need to think of your work a little more as a process and a little less as art. That’s not to say beautiful designs aren’t important; they are. But not everything you create needs to be 100% custom for every customer.

## Sound advice. Once you have your workflow a little more retooled around building at scale, what’s next on the list?

The next thing I’ve seen our most successful partners do is specialize in a few industry verticals. You may have had some success walking up and down main street and collecting customers of all different stripes, but after you’ve tooled up your site building flows, it makes a lot of sense to focus on a few customer segments to build for. For instance if you’ve created a few plumber websites in the past and have some experience with that industry, it’s probably a good target for you going forward. All you need to do is build a few of your own unique plumber site templates and start marketing to this vertical. This allows you to leverage any industry knowledge you’ve accumulated and streamlines your workflow. Both are key to ramping up customer acquisition. 

### Once you’ve focused on a few key verticals, I imagine you’d have to expand your geographic footprint. Is that right?

Absolutely. Digital agencies with around 50 websites are often so busy doing digital marketing for their customers, they forget to do digital marketing for themselves. If you’re going to pursue this growth strategy, you need to think about expanding the area you’re willing to serve. If you’re in Savannah, Georgia and have built your agency serving businesses in the city, maybe it’s time to think about all of Georgia. 

Thinking in this way can make it feel like a big undertaking, but remember you also want to shrink the number of verticals you serve. Now is the perfect time to start running “Best plumber websites in Georgia” Google, Facebook and YouTube ads. 

### So is this a time for agencies with around 50 websites to re-think their entire model of doing business? For example, should you consider adding a do-it-yourself website building flow to your service?

I would advise saving something like that for when you hit around 150-500 websites. Setting up an entirely new workflow can entail a fair amount of development work with Duda’s API and you’d need to figure out support. At around 50 websites, a do-it-for-me service is still your sweet spot. 

However, you may want to think about using roles and permissions to enable your customers to make minor site changes themselves and take some of the management responsibility off your team. I’ve seen a lot of partners free up time by letting customers manage eCommerce and blogs while restricting editing access to the rest of the site. 

### With more customers, I imagine there is a lot more support and ongoing site management. How do you work with your existing customers effectively and keep churn low? 

Keeping churn low is incredibly important for digital agencies with around 50 sites. The customers you have are all incredibly valuable and you don’t want your agency to turn into a revolving door for businesses. It’s important to remember these customers as you grow and you should offer incentives to stay. 

Exactly what you do to accomplish this task can take a variety of forms. I’ve seen our partners find success offering additional services beyond just web design and very basic online presence management. Our App Store allows you to offer all kinds of additional services, like CRMs and listings/reputation management, from within the platform, so this really shouldn’t be too difficult for those that are looking to expand. 

Another tactic I’ve seen work well is to offer discounted or free design refreshes. And of course, if you’ve started to work with more pre-built site sections and templates, the time it takes to finish those refreshes is a fraction of what it would be if you continue offering totally bespoke web design services. This is a great way to stop customers from churning out. 

Also, Site Comments is an absolute must-use feature. It allows you to communicate with your customers directly on top of a website while it’s being designed inside the Duda platform. This feature prompts your customers to really engage in the design process and reduces website build times by about a third. 

### Any other strategic advice you’d give to an agency with 50 sites looking to enter a growth phase?

Two things come to mind. First, a lot of digital agencies at this size have exclusively closed customers by providing them with a quote for how much a site will cost after a discussion about the scope of the project. That might still be fine for your most top-tier customers, but you want to offer structured plans to your customers that give them "good, better, best" options. You’ll definitely close more deals and spend less time haggling over costs. 

Secondly, I’d say you want to institute some sort of set regimen for the amount of support hours or design revisions you’ll provide to any single customer. An agreement that customers will receive a set amount of support hours and design changes with the plan they sign up for will keep you from burning up too much time on a single customer.
