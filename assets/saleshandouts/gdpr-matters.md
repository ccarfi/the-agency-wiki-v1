# GDPR Matters


Online privacy is important to all of us, and it is particularly relevant today, with the implementation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This privacy regulation, applicable in the EU and to any business that has customers there, has a direct and immediate effect on how online businesses collect and store data.

These resources can help your small business customers understand:
* The effect that GDPR has on business
* Why their business needs a privacy policy
* What is Consent Cookie Notification
* Why consent fields are needed on forms
* The concept of "personal data deletion"
