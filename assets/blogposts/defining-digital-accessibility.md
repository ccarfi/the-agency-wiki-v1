#Defining Digital Accessibility

Digital accessibility means a full range of users, including those who have a disability, can navigate, understand and interact with your digital content.

15% of the worldÕs population has some form of disability, including 25% of the US population. Of that group, many are blind, color blind, epileptic, dyslexic, have low vision or have other related conditions. That means a there are many individuals who may be locked out if your website isnÕt accessible. 

##Common Issues
Here are some common digital accessibility issues:

* Low color contrast. Foreground and background colors need a 4.5 to 1 contrast for normal text; 3 to 1 for larger text (14 point or larger).
* Keyboard accessibility. Users can utilize the keyboard to access all content and functionality.
* Visual focus: A content element has a visible outline.
* Missing alt text on images. An accurate description of each image for screen reader users. 
* Descriptive link text. ÒClick hereÓ or Òread moreÓ are too ambiguous. 

Are you losing significant market share with an inaccessible website?

##Why it Matters

Fact is, if a website isnÕt coded correctly, with individuals who use assistive technologies in mind, your website is broken for millions. A significant percentage of your prospective customer base is locked out. Can you afford that? This group, and their friends and family, represents $8 trillion in disposable income.1 

Are you losing business and brand awareness because of an inaccessible website? Are you at risk for a costly digital accessibility lawsuit?
