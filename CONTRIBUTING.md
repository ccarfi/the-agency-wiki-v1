## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "what makes an agency successful." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* The Agency Wiki assets are released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution has been edited and checked for grammar, you will need to address issues before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add shameleessly self-promotional content.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this project, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new resource, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Style guide
If you're writing content, see the [style guide](./docs/styleguide.md) to help your prose match the rest of the resources.

## Community

Discussions about The Agency Wiki take place on this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/ccarfi/the-agency-wiki-v1/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ccarfi/the-agency-wiki-v1/pulls) sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations. There is also a [mailing list](URL TBD) for regular updates.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
