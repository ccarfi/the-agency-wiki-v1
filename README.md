The Agency Wiki ([theagencywiki.org](http://theagencywiki.org)) is an initiative to develop the ultimate open source resource for digital agencies, SaaS companies, and all web pros that offer websites to customers. 

The Agency Wiki enables agency owners and designers around the globe to share white label assets and related digital agency resources. Anyone can contribute and content is edited and curated by community members. 

## Background
The Agency Wiki was created by and is curated by Duda, along with input from outside community reviewers, but the resources here are not exclusive to Duda products. One reason we started this project is because we felt that there weren't enough resources for the agency community to grow their businesses.

Our goal is to aggregate community best practices. Therefore, we try to use examples and quotations from others to illustrate our points.
