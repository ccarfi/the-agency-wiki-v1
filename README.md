The Agency Wiki (https://needs.a.url) contains a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to *GOAL*.

## Background
Open Source Guides were created and are curated by Duda, along with input from outside community reviewers, but they are not exclusive to Duda products. One reason we started this project is because we felt that there weren't enough resources for GOAL.

Our goal is to aggregate community best practices. Therefore, we try to use examples and quotations from others to illustrate our points.
